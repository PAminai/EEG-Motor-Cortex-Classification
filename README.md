Classification of different types of motor cortex EEG signal based on Machine Learning algorithm.
In this project I have developed an algorithm based on ML technique that can classify different types of EEG signal which is related to motor cortex.
This algorithm contains following parts:
* SNR maximization
* Correlation function

This project was done for National Brain Mapping Lab.
